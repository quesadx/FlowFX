FlowFX UI spacing/padding standards (inspired by PrincipalView)

Core spacings
- Container to container gaps (VBox/HBox spacing): 4.0 unless otherwise annotated.
- Section spacers (medium breaks): 12.0.
- Large spacers (rare, for visual separation like link rows): 24.0.
- TilePane gaps: hgap 4.0, vgap 4.0.
- Side rails/margins around main content: 4.0.

Padding
- Buttons (all MFXButton variants): 8.0 on all sides (top/right/bottom/left).
- Icon-only control buttons (window controls, edit, expand, return): 8.0 on all sides.
- Container-sub inner padding (cards, rows): 4.0 on all sides.
- Label/Icon wrappers inside input rows: 4.0 on all sides.

Notes
- Keep the flat/minimal style; do not introduce extra padding beyond the rules above.
- For hover/pressed/focused states in CSS, always restate radius and any borders explicitly.
- If a view needs different spacing, annotate the exception inline in FXML and here.

Audit 2025-08-09
- Enforced 8px padding on primary/action buttons across views.
- Normalized a stray spacing (10 -> 12) in MainView header actions.
- Aligned WidgetComponent content padding 20 -> 4 to match container-sub inner padding rule.
